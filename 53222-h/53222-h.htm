<h2><i>Preface.</i></h2>

<p>This pamphlet has been printed and published with the
assistance of friends who share my opinion that the scheme
proposed will solve the railway problem&mdash;now at an acute
stage.</p>

<p>A rough outline of the Scheme has been submitted to
Sir Charles Cameron, Bart. (on whose initiative sixpenny
telegrams were adopted), and while reserving his opinion as
to the advantages of State ownership and the difficulties of
purchase, he has been good enough to write that this scheme
is the boldest and best reasoned plea for the Nationalisation
of Railways that he has come across.</p>

<p>The scheme has also been submitted to, among others,
Mr. Emil Davies, Chairman of the Railway Nationalisation
Society, to Mr. L. G. Chiozza Money, M.P., and to Mr. Philip
Snowden, M.P., all of whom have expressed their approval
subject to the figures and estimates being correct. These
figures and estimates are based on the Official Board of Trade
returns for Railways of 1911 and 1912.</p>

<p>I also had the temerity to submit my draft to Mr. W. M.
Acworth, the well-known Railway expert, who very courteously
gave me his views generally, although refraining from any detailed
criticism. I deal with his remarks at the end of <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter
IV.</a>, but may here mention that Mr. Acworth called my attention
to an article by himself on Railways in “Palgrave’s
Encyclopædia of Political Economy” published in 1899. In
such article he referred to a suggestion which had then been
made for uniform fares on the Postal system, and he dismissed
the idea in a sentence as impracticable, because no one would pay
for a short journey as much as 8d., then the average fare for
the whole country.</p>

<p>It is therefore evident that the principle of a flat rate is not
novel; yet I can find no reference in any books or pamphlets
on railways to any practical scheme for carrying it into effect.
Apparently it has been assumed that there can be only one
uniform rate, equivalent to the average rate, and that therefore
the proposal is quite impossible. The simple expedient of
dividing the traffic into the two kinds of “Fast” and “Slow,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
on the analogy of the Postal rate of one penny for letters and
sixpence for telegrams, overcomes this difficulty. The scheme
is in effect an extension to the Railway System of the principle
upon which the existing Postal System is founded, and therefore
involves Nationalisation.</p>

<p>As submitted to the above-named gentlemen, the draft
did not include my remarks on the principles which in my
opinion should govern all National and Municipal Trading,
and which are now contained in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a> The attention
of both opponents and advocates of Nationalisation is
particularly called to these principles, which I have not found
elsewhere, but which as laid down are believed to be absolutely
sound, and of the highest importance, as removing most, if
not all, of the objections of opponents, while retaining all the
advantages claimed by advocates of National and Municipal
Trading.</p>

<p>I do not pretend to be a railway expert, and have only
been able to devote the small leisure time available from an
exacting business to putting into writing the thoughts which
have exercised my mind for many years past. But the
well-known expert, Mr. Edwin A. Pratt, who is a strong
opponent of Railway Nationalisation, admits in one of his
books that “the greatest advances made by the Post Office
have been due to the persistence of outside and far-seeing
reformers, rather than to the Postal Officials themselves.”
This admission and the conviction that the further advance
now proposed is based upon sound principles and undisputed
facts, encourages me to submit my scheme with confidence
to the consideration of experts and the public.</p>

<b>The Scheme.</b></h3>

<p class="pp"><a href="#Page_17">Page 17.</a></p>

<p><b>All Railways</b> to be purchased by State and amalgamated with
General Post Office. Trains of two kinds only, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>(1) <b>Main Line Trains</b>, <i>i.e.</i>, non-stop for at least 30 miles.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Local Trains</b>, <i>i.e.</i>, all trains other than Main Line.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Passenger tickets</b> vary according to above fares only&mdash;no
reference to stations or distance. <b>Goods rates</b>, payable by stamps
vary only according to weight or size of goods, whether carried in
bulk, in open or closed trucks, or with special packing, but
irrespective of any other difference in nature or value of goods, or
of distance, as now with parcel post.</p>

<p><b>All Railway Stations to be Post Offices.</b> All Post Offices to
sell Railway Tickets, and, where required, to be Railway Receiving
Offices. <b>Steamers</b> to be regarded as trains.</p>

<h3><a href="#CHAPTER_II"><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span></a><br />
<b>Advantages of Scheme.</b></h3>

<p class="pp"><a href="#Page_20">Page 20.</a></p>

<p>1. <b>Cheapness</b> and regularity of transport.</p>

<p>2. <b>Economy</b> of service;&mdash;by unification of railways;&mdash;abolition
of Railway Clearing House, of expenses of varying rates
and fares, of multiplication of receiving offices, stations, &amp;c.,&mdash;and
by amalgamation with Post Office;&mdash;all railway land and buildings
available for Government purposes&mdash;Postal, Civil, Military and
Naval.</p>

<p>3. <b>Progressive increase always follows</b> adoption of small
uniform fares (<i>e.g.</i>, in Post Office); hence progressive increase of
revenue available for working expenses, purchase money, extensions,
improvements, and adoption of new safety appliances.</p>

<h3><a href="#CHAPTER_III"><span class="smcap">Chapter III.</span></a><br />
<b>Principles of Scheme.</b></h3>

<p class="pp"><a href="#Page_27">Page 27.</a></p>

<p><b>Present system</b> founded on two principles, both mistaken and
illogical, viz.:&mdash;(<b>1</b>) According to distance travelled. (<b>2</b>) According
to “what the traffic will bear.”</p>

<p>(1) Although cost of building 200 miles, and hauling train that
distance is more than for two miles, yet because regular train service
required for whole distance, say, A to Z and back, passing intermediate
places, therefore cost of travelling from A to B, or to N,
identical with A to Z. For goods, cost of loading and unloading
twice only, whether sent from A to B, or A to Z.</p>

<p>(2) Cost of hauling ton of coal exactly same as of bricks, sand,
loaded van, in open truck, yet now different rates for each,
according to “what the traffic will bear.”</p>

<p><b>True principle</b> advocated by Sir Rowland Hill in Penny Post&mdash;whole
country suffers by neglect or expense of transport to distant
parts, and gains by including small districts with same rates as
populous parts.</p>

<p><b>For a flat rate, three rules necessary.</b></p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>(<i>a</i>) Must not exceed lowest in use prior to adoption.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Increased traffic resulting must produce at least same
net revenue.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Variations of rate to be according to speed, not distance.</p>

</div>

<p>Hence:</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>(<i>a</i>) <b>1d.</b> now lowest fare, fixed for Local Lines.</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p><b>1s.</b> now lowest fare, (<i>e.g.</i>, 2s. 6d. return London to
Brighton) fixed for Main Lines.</p>

<p><b>1s. 6d.</b> per ton fixed for goods train or slow service,
as the present average for minerals, and allowing
present lowest rate for goods in open trucks, rising
to, say, 6d. per cwt. (10s. per ton) for small consignments,
in covered trucks.</p>

<p><b>10s.</b> per ton, now lowest “per passenger train” (<i>e.g.</i>,
6d. per cwt. for returned empties) fixed for fast
service.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The increased traffic dealt with under “Finance.”</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The two rates suggested for fast and slow trains
solve the difficulty hitherto felt of charging lowest
fare of 1d. as uniform fare&mdash;the 1s. fare and 10s.
goods rate being double the present averages.</p>

</div>

<h3><a href="#CHAPTER_IV"><span class="smcap">Chapter IV.</span></a><br />
<b>OBJECTIONS TO THE SCHEME.</b></h3>

<h4><b>1.&mdash;State Ownership.</b></h4>

<p class="pp"><a href="#Page_33">Page 33.</a></p>

<p>Writers for and against&mdash;All assume that on Nationalisation,
system followed of charging according to distance, and to
“what traffic will bear”&mdash;Fundamental differences between State
Monopoly and Private Monopoly&mdash;Evils of applying profits of
State monopolies in reductions of taxation&mdash;Strikes.</p>

<p>Four rules to be observed on Nationalisation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>1. Natural monopolies only to be taken over.</p>

<p>2. When taken over, only to be worked for benefit of
community and not for profit.</p>

<p>3. Competition of private enterprises not to be prohibited.</p>

<p>4. Monopoly to be worked by Department of State
responsible to Parliament.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Chief grounds of objection to State ownership</b>&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Difficulty of Government in dealing with conflicting interests
of traders and general public. (2) Difficulty of Railway servants
(being also voters) using political pressure to obtain better wages,
against interests of traders and general public. Both of these
objections removed if scheme (which avoids all preferential or
differential rates or treatment) adopted with above four rules.</p>

<p>Other grounds of objection, <i>e.g.</i>, want of competition, officialism,
&amp;c., apply equally to present Company system, but may be
remedied if owned by State. Suggested remedies:&mdash;Railway Council
to deal with all matters of administration; Railway Courts to deal
with questions of compensation, labour disputes, &amp;c. Railways and
Post Office being Department of State with Cabinet Minister at
head subject to vote of censure in Parliament, provides better
security for public than private Companies or Railway Trust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<h4><b>2.&mdash;General Objections.</b></h4>

<p class="pp"><a href="#Page_43">Page 43.</a></p>

<p><b>Fear of Losses</b>&mdash;</p>

<p>All existing staffs required for increased traffic&mdash;therefore no
loss to them.</p>

<p>Traders, like newspapers more than make up for any losses
by economy in rates and fares and increased circulation.</p>

<p>Mr. Acworth’s objections to “average” rates considered.</p>

<h1>ROYAL RAILWAYS<br />
with Uniform Rates.</h1>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p><b>The Royal Mail!</b> What scenes and memories are conjured
up by these words! In the olden days, the Royal Mail coaches&mdash;in
these modern days, the well-known scarlet Mail carts and
motor vans arriving at all the larger railway stations from which
the mail trains, always the fastest, convey the mails to every
quarter of the United Kingdom, and over the whole world.</p>

<p>It is now a commonplace to post in the nearest pillar-box a
batch of letters, some to addresses in the same town, others to
provincial towns and villages, to Scotland, Ireland and far distant
Colonies, each of them being conveyed to their destination,
near or far, for the modest sum of one penny, by the speediest
mode of locomotion that steam and electricity can provide. In
order that travellers may have the advantage of that speed and
regularity which is a feature of the Royal Mail, passengers and
goods have always been carried by the Mail&mdash;formerly by the
coach, now by the train. But whereas the mails are carried at
the same price for any distance, the charges for passengers, and
for goods which exceed the regulation size and weight permitted
for the “Parcels Post,” vary according to the distance travelled,
and as to goods also according to their nature or quality, with the
result that for the greater part of our population long journeys
are luxuries which can only be undertaken in cases of life and
death, and not always then; the rates for carriage of goods by
fast train are mostly prohibitive, and even by goods train for
long distances are so great as to seriously restrict the traffic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>If mail trains can carry mails, with parcels up to 7 lbs. in
weight at the same price for any distance, why cannot all trains
carry passengers and goods of any size and weight at the same
price for any distance? The answer is that they can, and it is
the object of this pamphlet to prove not only that it is possible
financially, but that, with the small uniform fares and rates indicated
on the title page, sufficient revenue can be obtained to pay
working expenses, and provide the sum required to purchase the
whole of the existing railway undertakings at their full market
price, or such a price as willing vendors would be ready to accept.</p>

<p>This, then, is “<b>A Business Proposition</b>” for all concerned;
in other words, the magnificent net-work of railways in
the United Kingdom, with all that is included in their undertakings,
may be acquired by the nation at such a price as will
make it worth the while of the present Companies and their shareholders
to sell, and as the result to give the nation the benefit of
speedy and efficient transport at the nominal fares and rates
mentioned. It will, indeed, be a “Revolution,” but one of the
most beneficial that can befall a nation.</p>

<p>The Royal Mail is an institution of which the nation is justly
proud. How much more will it be so of an institution which will
include the Royal Mail, namely, <b>Royal Railways</b>.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
THE SCHEME.</h2>

<p>This is the scheme proposed:&mdash;</p>

<p>The whole of the existing undertakings of all the Railway
Companies in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
will be acquired by purchase on some such terms as are set out
at the end of this pamphlet and vested in the Government. The
whole system will be amalgamated with the General Post Office
and form one of the Departments of State, of which the Postmaster-General
for the time being will be the head, and probably
adopt the style of “Minister of Transport,” who will be a Member
of the Cabinet. <b>It will be expressly enacted that any profit
made by the combined services shall be used only for
increasing their efficiency, for payment of purchase money,
or in reduction of fares and rates charged for the services,
and in no case for general revenue of the country. There
shall also be no prohibition of competition by private enterprise.</b><a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>All passenger trains will be regarded as consisting of two
kinds, namely:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>(1) <b>Main Line Trains</b>, by which will be meant express
trains running on the Main trunk lines between, and only
stopping at, important towns.</p>

</div>

<p>A ticket for <b>one shilling</b> will entitle the holder to enter any
Main Line train at any station, and to travel in it to any other
station at which it stops, and a ticket for <b>five shillings</b> will
entitle him to travel first class in such trains.</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>(2) <b>Local Trains</b>, by which will be meant all trains, other
than Main Line trains as defined above, including all
Metropolitan, Suburban and Branch Line trains throughout
the Kingdom, as well as trains on Main lines which
stop at all stations.</p>

</div>

<p>A ticket for <b>one penny</b> will entitle the holder to enter any
Local train at any station, and to travel in it to any other station
at which it stops, and a ticket for <b>sixpence</b> will entitle him
to travel first class in such train if that accommodation is provided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Steamers</b> which form part of the railway undertakings will
also be regarded as of two kinds, according to whether they form
part of a Main Line, <i>e.g.</i>, the Irish Packets or the Cross Channel
steamers, in which case admission to them will be 1s. or 5s.,
according to class, or simply as part of a Branch line, <i>e.g.</i>, the
Isle of Wight steamers, to which admission would be 1d. or 6d.
according to class.</p>

<p>In the case of Main Line trains and steamers, additional fixed
charges (the same for any distance) will be made for the use of
refreshment cars, sleeping cars, State cabins, reserved seats and
any other special services.</p>

<p>In the case of Local trains, and possibly Main Line trains,
<b>Season Tickets</b> may be issued, in each case available for
any Main Line train or Local train as the case may be. For
Local trains the following rates are suggested, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Suggested rates for local trains">
  <tr>
    <td>3rd class</td>
    <td>1s. per week,</td>
    <td>4s. per month,</td>
    <td>£2 per annum.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1st class</td>
    <td>2s. 6d. <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
    <td>10s. <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
    <td>£5 <span class="ditto1">”</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><b>Passenger Tickets</b> will not be issued to or from any particular
stations, but like postage stamps will vary only according
to the fares and special charges for the time being in force.
The four denominations of 5s., 1s., 6d. and 1d. will, of course,
be required, and 4s. and 5d. tickets could also be issued to make
up the first class fares with the 1s. and 1d. tickets.</p>

<p>These tickets will be sold not only at every railway station,
but also at every Post Office and in automatic machines. Every
railway station will be, or will contain, a Post Office, with all
postal, telegraphic and telephonic facilities, and every Post Office
will sell not only passenger tickets but also railway stamps for
parcels, goods and live stock.</p>

<p><b>Goods traffic</b> will also consist of two services only, namely:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>(1) <b>Fast Service</b>, corresponding with the present service
“per passenger train,” the charge for which will be an
average of <b>ten shillings per ton for any distance</b>.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Slow Service</b>, corresponding with the present service
“per goods train,” the charge for which will be an
average of <b>one shilling and sixpence per ton for any
distance</b>.</p>

</div>

<p>For both these services stamps will be issued of various denominations,
and applied in manner now in use for the Parcels
Post, with any necessary modification; for instance, the stamps
might be affixed to consignment notes in the case of goods in
bulk, or other suitable arrangements might be made for large
quantities of goods.</p>

<p>For the <i>slow</i> goods traffic a regular service of goods trains
will be organised so that at every town or village in the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Kingdom served by rail there may be at least one delivery and
one collection daily, more populous places, of course, having
more frequent services.</p>

<p>For the <i>fast</i> goods traffic a similar regular service will be
organised, and in cases where the traffic will warrant it special
fast goods trains will be run; otherwise the goods will be carried
by the passenger trains.</p>

<p>In course of time provision should be made for all trunk
lines to have at least two double lines of rails, upon one of which
fast trains for passengers and goods will run at uniform
speeds, and at regular intervals, and upon the other the local
trains and slow goods trains, also at uniform speed and at regular
intervals.</p>

<p>The present complicated system of differential rates, which
vary not only according to distance but also according to the
nature, quality and value of goods, and involving different rates,
amounting in number literally to millions, would be swept away,
the only variations in rates being in respect of such obvious
matters as weight, size, whether carried in bulk or in packages,
in open trucks or closed, whether requiring special care or labour
in packing or otherwise. The average rates proposed would, it
is believed, admit of a uniform rate for any distance for minerals
and other goods carried in bulk in open trucks, of no more than
the lowest rate now in force, by charging higher rates for goods
requiring closed trucks and more labour in handling, still higher
rates for goods of abnormal size or weight, and higher rates still
for single small parcels, on account of greater proportionate expense
of handling. For the small single parcels the rate might
be for slow service as much as 6d. for any weight up to 1cwt.
(equal to 10s. per ton), and for fast service say 1s., or possibly
more, for any weight up to 1cwt., the weight being graduated
downwards for parcels of greater weight as are the rates now in
force for letter and parcels post. The goods traffic would be in
effect an extension of the present parcels post, the present rates
for which would probably be capable of very substantial reduction.</p>

<p>These figures are put forward by way of suggestion only, and
the question of terminal charges and fees for loading and unloading
may have to be taken into account. Numerous details
must necessarily be gone into in fixing an average uniform rate,
and it is very likely that considerable modifications may be found
necessary. Any such modifications, however, must be based upon
the three rules set out on <a href="#Page_30">page 30</a> in order that the scheme may
effect its object.</p>

ADVANTAGES OF THE SCHEME.</h2>

<p>If this scheme is practicable financially (and one object of this
pamphlet is to prove that this is so), then it seems almost superfluous
to point out the great advantages of its adoption.</p>

<p>It has been well said that “<b>transport is the life-blood of a
nation</b>.” If circulation is impeded or restricted the whole country
must suffer, and, conversely, if all obstructions and restrictions
are removed the whole country must benefit. This scheme will,
in effect, remove the principal obstruction to free circulation of
passengers and goods, namely, expense. Cheapness of transport
is “twice blessed; it blesseth him that gives and him that
takes”&mdash;in other words, it enables the producer, whether agriculturist,
manufacturer or merchant, to increase his market for
goods, and enables the consumer who requires those goods to
purchase at a lower price. It is common knowledge that agriculture
in particular in this country is hampered and restricted
by heavy charges for freight.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Under our present system the
carriage of goods from abroad to London is cheaper than from
the Midlands, and the foreigner has a great preference (so far as
freight is concerned) over our own farmers. Fruit and fish is
often thrown away on account of the cost of carriage being more
than the value of the goods. On the other hand, the price of
food and every commodity has been gradually increasing. With
the removal of this obstruction of expense of carriage there must
be an increase in the supply of goods, and increased supply means
lower prices.</p>

<p>As to passenger traffic, traders will appreciate the great benefit
of nominal fares for themselves and their commercial travellers.
So also will the greater part of the population, namely, those of
very moderate means who are now prevented, solely on account
of expense, from travelling any considerable distance, either on
business or pleasure, or from visiting friends and relatives.</p>

<p>These are some of the general advantages attending cheapness
of transport, but it may be as well to point out in detail some of
the very substantial economies and other special advantages to be
obtained by adopting the proposed scheme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<h3>1. ECONOMICAL ADVANTAGES.</h3>

both of money and time will illustrate some of these advantages.</p>

</div>

<p>Within sight, at the other end of Norfolk Street, is the Temple
Station District Railway, and at 6, Catherine Street, about the
same distance from the other side of the Strand, is a Labour
Exchange.</p>

<p>It is assumed that the rents of shops in the Strand would
average about £500 per annum. Under the proposed scheme,
the whole of the business transacted at the above eight premises
could, with greater convenience, be carried on at the two railway
stations, possibly with some extensions, but with a saving not
only of rent but also of rates, taxes and other outgoings.</p>

<p><b>At Bexhill-on-Sea</b>, with a population of only about 15,500,
there are two large railway stations, one belonging to the South
Eastern &amp; Chatham Railway Company, the other to the London,
Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway Company, and situate about a
mile apart. Half a mile from each is the Head Post Office, within
a few doors from one of the stations is a branch Post Office, and
within a small radius are Government offices for Inland Revenue
and other purposes.</p>

<p>Letters posted at a pillar box outside the station are collected
there, taken to the Head Post Office for sorting, then returned
with others to the railway for the Mail train leaving the same
station. The majority of the passengers are for London, and
go by the two different routes, but the fares are identical, and
the time occupied is about the same, no advantage being gained
by the public through the so-called competition.</p>

<p>If both stations were amalgamated one staff only would be
required, there would be ample room on the premises to accommodate
the Head Post Office with sorting rooms, etc. (the branch
office now near the station would not be required), and there would
be plenty of room also for the Government Offices. In addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to the saving of expense, there would also be the great convenience
and saving of time in the transport of, and dealing with, mails,
passengers and goods.</p>

<p>These two examples with many others have come under my
personal observation, and they may be multiplied ten thousand
times throughout the United Kingdom. Where is there a railway
station, whether a great London terminus, or small provincial
station, where postal facilities are available; while just outside
rents are paid, in some cases very heavy ones, for other
premises, to and from which the mails have to be conveyed?</p>

<p>Other examples of waste under the present system, although
not so apparent to the public, are well-known to the railway
expert, and involve much greater expenditure of time and money.</p>

<p>I refer in particular to the <b>waste of rolling stock</b>, especially of
goods wagons, occasioned by the multiplicity of goods stations,
the transfer of rolling stock to and from the lines of different railway
companies, the shunting of trains, and the large number of
road vans used by the various companies. In London alone there
are 74 goods stations, used for goods only, and 700 goods trains
per day travel between these 74 stations, doing nothing but transferring
goods from one of these stations to another! Goods
consigned to one warehouse in London from places on, say, seven
different railway companies’ lines are sent by seven different
vans, one belonging to each company. Under my proposed
scheme one or two central goods stations of large area would
not only suffice, but would provide a far more efficient and speedy
transport service, and yet with the nominal rates referred to.</p>

<p>Under the present system goods trains, having been unloaded,
must be returned in order to clear the line, so that it is not uncommon
to find goods trains belonging to the various companies
returning empty for long distances on each line, on the G. W. R.
as far as Bristol, on the S. W. R. to Basingstoke, on the G. C. R.
to Banbury, and so on. It has been estimated that of the
1,400,000 goods wagons now on the railways of the United
Kingdom, no more than 3 per cent. are actually in effective use
at one time, the remaining 97 per cent. being either stationary
or running empty!<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> One reason for this, no doubt, is the use of
merely hand labour for loading and unloading.</p>

<p>With a view to avoiding this waste the New Transport Company,
Limited was registered in 1908, for the purpose of introducing
new and ingenious machinery, invented by Mr. A. W.
Gattie and Mr. A. G. Seaman, for handling goods, including the
adoption of movable “containers” on trucks and wagons, and
a scheme for a “Goods Clearing House” occupying a site of
about 30 acres, in Clerkenwell, to be connected by rail with all
the lines coming to London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>It is, of course, necessary, in order to carry so important a
scheme into effect to negotiate with all the various railway companies
interested, as well as to obtain an Act of Parliament.
Besides this, a large amount of capital is required for the acquisition
of the site, the construction of the connecting lines, installation
of the machinery, etc.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the large cost, estimated by Mr. Edgar
Harper, F.S.S., late Statistical Officer of the London County
Council, at £14,000,000, he shows that such a system would more
than pay for itself in a year by the economies in transport which
it would effect directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>No estimate, however, is given, nor probably can be given by
anyone, of the time that will be occupied in carrying such a scheme
into effect, so long as this present system of numerous companies
and conflicting interests continues. Five years have already
gone by since the Company was registered.</p>

<p>If, however, the scheme of nationalisation and amalgamation
with the Post Office be adopted, there should be no difficulty in
providing as part of such scheme for the system and machinery
of the New Transport Company already referred to, not only in
London but in every other traffic centre. It might also be possible
to avoid the expense of acquiring a new site for a “Goods Clearing
House” by utilising some portion of the large area occupied
by the three large termini and approaches thereto of King’s Cross,
St. Pancras and Euston.</p>

<p>There will then be no conflicting interests, no multiplicity of
companies, and no difficulty in raising the necessary capital for
establishing the system, and what is still more important, no
difficulty, as will be shown hereafter under the heading of
“Finance,” in producing the necessary revenue to repay the
capital and interest, by reason of the progressively increasing
traffic which will result from the adoption of the small uniform
average rates advocated.</p>

<p>The following, then, are some of the very substantial economies
which will be effected by my scheme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p><b>I. Expenditure which would be entirely abolished</b>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>(<i>a</i>) The Railway Clearing House, the sole object of which
is to apportion receipts and payments between the
various companies, about 217 in number, and requiring
for its work a large and expensive staff, not only of
clerks, but also of inspectors at every junction, and a
large establishment at Seymour Street, Euston.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The separate Boards of Directors, officers, and clerical
staff of all the separate companies.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The legal and parliamentary expenses incurred in disputes
between the various companies, and in opposing
rival companies’ new lines.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Advertisements by rival companies of their own routes.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p><b>II. Expenditure and waste which would be diminished</b>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p><b>1. By reason of unification of systems.</b></p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>(<i>a</i>) Competing receiving offices and their staffs would be
reduced to one in each locality.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Rolling stock, which is now often idle because owned
by different companies, could be used solely according
to the requirements of the traffic.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Competing trains now running on different lines at the
same time between London and other large towns could
be run at different times with largely increased numbers
of passengers at same cost.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Adjoining stations belonging to competing companies
would be amalgamated.</p>

</div>

<p><b>2. By reason of the adoption of uniform rates and fares.</b></p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>(<i>a</i>) The abolition of the elaborate book-keeping and staffs
needful for the present complicated system of passengers’
fares and goods rates, especially the latter, with
the waste not only of expense but also of time.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The saving of the expense of printing and advertising
various priced tickets and fare tables, also of the large
staff of booking clerks, inspectors and others.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The saving of the legal expenses now incurred by the
Railway and Canal Commission Court in appeals and
disputes between the companies and traders as to rates,
etc.</p>

</div>

<p><b>3. By reason of the amalgamation of railways with the
Post Office.</b></p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>(<i>a</i>) The rent and expenses of numerous Post Offices in the
neighbourhood of railway stations would be saved, all
stations being used for postal purposes.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) All postal sorting and other offices could be situate on
railway premises in or near the stations, and besides
thus saving the rent would be in closer touch with the
railway.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The whole of the railway tracks would be available
without rent for laying of telegraph and telephone
wires, either over or underground.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Surplus land of the railways, in particular where adjoining
to stations, would be available for other Government
purposes, such as Inland Revenue Offices, Labour
Exchanges, Military, Naval or Civil Service purposes,
Police Stations, Fire Stations, County Courts, Police
Courts, Land Courts, as well as Courts for dealing with
questions arising out of the railways themselves.</p>

<h3>2. GENERAL ADVANTAGES.</h3>

<p>Unification enables each part of the country to have as good
a service of trains as every other part, notwithstanding differences
of population and resources. The Companies now operating on
the South Coast cannot provide so good a service as the Northern
Companies owing to the lack of the great mining and industrial
centres which are served by the latter.</p>

<p>One of the most conspicuous examples of this is <b>Ireland</b>. A
Royal Commission was sitting for many years on the question
of Irish railways, and ultimately reported in favour of State
acquisition. Even this, it is clear, would not entirely solve the
difficulty, which arises from the natural causes of being an island
with (compared to the rest of Great Britain) a small population,
mostly agricultural. If, however, the Irish railways were amalgamated
with all the others of the United Kingdom under the proposed
scheme the problem is solved. In the estimate given in
considering the finance of the scheme the Irish railways are included.</p>

<p>The conversion of the railway system into Government property
will, apart from the question of economy already referred
to, provide a most important advantage to the State. For
example, the War Office can make use of the railway system, not
only for the purposes of transport, but for the erection on surplus
land throughout the country of barracks, stores, and other buildings,
for wireless telegraph stations and for aviation purposes.
The Admiralty will have the use of the great docks and wharves
now owned by railways. The Civil Service will also find ample
space for additional office accommodation, often in the most
convenient spots both in town and country.</p>

<p>Still more important even than these advantages is the fact
that by the removal of all money restrictions from transport, not
only an immediate but a <b>progressive increase of traffic</b> will result.
That this will be so is shown hereafter when considering the
question of the finance of the scheme, but it is referred to here
as one of the most important advantages of the scheme, apart
from the benefits to the nation already referred to of free circulation
of passengers and goods.</p>

<p>In the first place, the increase of traffic will require in all
probability the whole of the staff now employed, who would otherwise
be thrown out of employment by reason of the economies
referred to above. It will be noticed that in the estimates given
under the heading of “Finance of the Scheme” no decrease,
but on the contrary, a slight increase has been estimated for in
the working expenses, notwithstanding the enormous saving to
be anticipated by the abolition and reduction of wasteful expenditure
under the present system. My reason for so doing is
partly to err on the side of caution in the estimates, but also to
provide for the probability of having to retain the whole of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
existing staff, and possibly increasing their wages and reducing
their hours of labour. Most of the economies referred to must
necessarily be effected gradually; for instance, the clerical staffs
of the various railway companies and of the Railway Clearing
House would be required for some considerable time in the process
of winding-up, and by the time this is finished the traffic will
have still further increased and their work will then be required
in the more necessary departments of, say, the Goods Clearing
Houses throughout the country.</p>

<p>Secondly, the progressive increase of traffic will produce a
corresponding increase of revenue which will be available for
extensions and additions, for electrification of lines, and other
improvements in means of transport, and ultimately even in still
further reduction in charges, but last and by no means least in
the adoption of appliances and inventions for the safety of life
and limb both of passengers and railway servants.</p>

<p>Unlike the present companies, the Government will have
no difficulty in raising the capital required for any such purposes,
and in relying upon the inevitable increase of traffic, as now is
the case of the Post Office, for repayment.</p>

<p>Take the case of automatic couplings. These were invented
40 years ago<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and their adoption has been urged on the companies
ever since, not only on the merciful ground of saving life and
limb, but also on the financial ground of saving waste of time
in shunting; but the initial expense of fitting these to every truck
and carriage has been too much for the directors of the Companies
to risk.</p>

<p>Many inventions for automatic signalling, instantaneous
brakes, and other life-saving appliances have been from time to
time submitted to railway companies, but the initial expense of
installation throughout the many miles of railway of each company
has been so great that one hardly wonders at the hesitation
of directors in laying out money belonging to the shareholders,
especially when, notwithstanding a small normal increase of
traffic, the working expenses have increased to a greater degree.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
THE PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH THE SCHEME IS BASED.</h2>

<p>At first sight it seems preposterous that the fare <b>from London
to Glasgow should be only one shilling</b>, the same as from London
to Brighton, or that the fare of one penny from Mansion House
to Victoria should be the same as from Victoria to Croydon. To
a railway expert it will doubtless appear still more preposterous
that the rate for a ton of iron-ore should be the same as for a
ton of manufactured iron, and that the rate for general merchandise
should be as low as 1s. 6d. per ton for any distance; and
yet it is now considered a matter of course that the rate of 1d.
for 4 ozs. for a letter from London to Londonderry should be the
same as from one part of London to another, or 3d. for 1 lb.
should be the rate by parcel post for any distance great or small,
and irrespective of what the contents of the parcel may be.</p>

<p>The system of charging for transport <b>according to distance</b>,
which is still in force throughout the civilised world, except in
the Postal Service, appears to me to be <b>founded on a wrong
principle</b>. It has no doubt been adopted on the assumption that
the greater the cost of production the greater should be the
charge, and, therefore, that as it costs more to build 100 miles
of railway than one mile, and takes more coal or electric current
to haul a train for 100 miles than for one mile, it is necessary to
charge more for the longer distance. Even the Post Office still
clings to the same idea, in charging higher rates for the telephone
trunk service according to distance, although the charges for
telegrams are the same for any distance! It is significant that
whereas the net profits from railways remain more or less stationary,
that of the Post Office with uniform rates continually increases,
and that the telephone system with charges according
to distance is so far the least satisfactory branch of the Post
Office.</p>

<p>It is no doubt a general rule that the price of an article depends
upon the cost of production, but when dealing with transport
the analogy fails. In the case of a national system of railways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the provision of a regular service of trains to and from all parts
of the country is a necessity. Such a service requires that trains
must run at stated intervals advertised beforehand from one
terminus to another, say from A to Z, with various stopping
places between those points, which may be represented by other
letters of the alphabet. The cost of running each train will be
the same, whether it contains 20 passengers or 200, whether
some or all of the passengers alight from or board the train at
any intermediate station or at either terminus. Therefore, the
actual cost of carrying a passenger from A to Z is not, in fact,
more than from A to B, or from M to Z.</p>

<p>The same consideration applies to goods with even greater
force. With goods the cost of handling them has to be considered,
as well as the cost of haulage. If goods are sent from
A to B only they must be handled twice, and this is no more than
if they are sent from A to Z, assuming there is no need for change
of trucks.</p>

<p>In the case of goods under the present system there is a
further principle acted upon, which is still more obviously a wrong
one, <i>viz.</i>, what is known as charging <b>according to “what the
traffic will bear.”</b> This term is well known to all railway experts,
and is a convenient way of explaining the reasons governing the
various rates under the present system. For instance, if too
high a rate is charged for goods of comparatively small value,
traders prefer to send by the cheaper modes, namely, by sea or
by road, and in many cases it would not be worth while to send
at all, whereas in the case of an article like silk or bullion of
considerable value the extra cost of carriage even at a high rate
would not add appreciably to the price. Therefore, the railway
companies are compelled to make lower charges for low-priced
goods, otherwise they would lose the traffic altogether.
Accordingly there are such anomalies as a higher rate for the
carriage of manufactured iron than of iron-ore for the same distance,
although the cost of trucks, of haulage, and of handling
may be identical. Again, the rate for carriage of meat from the
Midlands to London is greater than that from Liverpool to London,
partly on account of the competition of the sea, and partly
on account of the large consignments of foreign meat. Again,
the rate for the carriage of bricks from one part of London to
another is greater than from Peterborough to London, because
Peterborough is in a brick-producing district. These inconsistencies
and anomalies are intensified by the necessity of the goods
having to be carried over the lines of several different railway
companies, all of whom must receive some profit out of the
carriage of the goods, in addition to the actual cost.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that the actual cost of haulage for the same distance
of say a ton of coal is no more than that of a ton of bricks or
of manufactured iron, or of sand, or of a pantechnicon full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
furniture, all of which can be carried in open trucks, yet the rates
for all these various goods, even for the same distance, differ
widely from each other under the present system, and differ again
not only according to distance but actually according to the
different towns between which the service is rendered. Many
examples of the present anomalies are strikingly shown by
Mr. Emil Davies in his book, “The Case for Railway Nationalisation,”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
which should be read by all interested in the subject.</p>

<p>Now assume that the whole of the various existing railways
are amalgamated; that Main line trains both for goods and
passengers run at regular intervals to and from the principal
towns; that Local trains run from station to station and on
branch lines also at regular intervals, connecting at junctions
with Main line trains; that just as there are now regular times
for delivery and collections of letters and parcels by post, varying
in number according to the population of each locality, so there
are regular collections and deliveries of goods to and from every
town and village in the United Kingdom; and that a uniform
rate, no more than, or even less than, the smallest rate now
charged, is all that has to be paid. It is true that with such a
system at many of the smaller places the actual expense of
collection and delivery may, indeed, be “more than the traffic
would bear,” certainly much more than the Directors of a railway
company would feel warranted in risking under the present system
with their necessarily limited area, but when these smaller places
are part of such a system as is here described, extending to every
town in the United Kingdom, then the whole becomes self-supporting,
and there is no advantage in charging, either according
to distance, or according to “what the traffic will bear.”</p>

<p>Every little village Post Office in the United Kingdom is an
object-lesson to us. Here we have all the resources of civilisation,
letter and parcel post, telegraph, telephone, savings bank,
money orders, all provided at exactly the same rate as in the
largest Cities of the Empire. Although the actual expense of
each village Post Office taken by itself is out of all proportion to
the population of the district, the combination of all of them in
one national unified system enables these remote villages to benefit,
not only with no financial loss to the nation, but actually with a
handsome net profit which has actually contributed to the general
revenue of the nation. This was not contemplated when the
Penny Post was established, and is a practice which, in my view,
is a great mistake, as explained in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a></p>

<p>The same principle has been applied to the ordinary roads
of the country, which are now open free of charge to the whole
population, although many of this generation can still remember
the restrictions of the old toll-gates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>It is only applying the same principle to the nation which applies
to the human body. “The body is not one member, but many.…
Whether one member suffers, all the members suffer
with it, or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with
it.”</p>

<p>If from any cause, such as a flood or other physical disturbance
a small industrial or agricultural district were cut off from all
communication with the rest of the Country, it is not only that
district but also the whole of the Country which suffers loss,
namely, the loss of trade with that district. And if by reason of
high rates the remote towns, villages, and districts, as well as
those nearer to great centres, are prevented from obtaining an
outlet for their produce, the whole Country suffers. The converse
is equally true: as soon as free circulation of passengers and
goods is provided, the prosperity of the whole Country as well as
of each district is increased.</p>

<p>This, then, is the principle upon which the scheme of uniform
fares and rates is founded, as opposed to the existing system of
charging according to distance and according to “what the traffic
will bear.” There remains, however, to be considered the
principle upon which the particular uniform fares and rates mentioned
on the <a href="#Page_6">title page</a> have been suggested for the proposed
scheme. These have not been selected at haphazard, but in
accordance with three rules which, I believe, are founded upon a
sound principle, namely:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p><b>(1) That any flat rate to be successful must not exceed
the minimum rate in force prior to the adoption of the
scheme</b>;</p>

<p><b>(2) That there should result from the change a sufficient
increase of traffic to produce at least the same net
revenue as before</b>;</p>

<p><b>(3) That in a system of transport the fares and rates
should vary, not according to distance travelled, but
according to speed of service.</b></p>

</div>

<p>In accordance with these rules I take <b>for Passenger Traffic</b>
first the present minimum railway fare now charged, that is, 1d.
for short distances of one mile or under. If the flat rate were
fixed at say 2d., or, indeed, any sum over 1d., passengers who
now pay that sum would have to pay at least double the existing
fare; this would, of course, render the whole scheme impracticable.
On the other hand, under a flat rate of 1d. throughout
the whole country the receipts would not be sufficient to produce
the present revenue unless and until the number of passengers
carried should increase by as much as six or seven times. That this
is so is clear when it is remembered that the <b>present average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
railway fare for the whole of the United Kingdom</b> (allowing
for season ticket holders), <b>is 6½d.</b> In other words, if all the
passengers now travelling would pay 6½d. for every journey,
both for short ones, as from Mansion House to Charing
Cross, and long ones, as from London to Londonderry, then
the same gross revenue from passengers would be obtained
as now; or, on the other hand, if a flat rate of 1d. any
distance were fixed, and the number of passenger journeys
were increased by six-and-a-half times as a result of this great reduction,
then, again, the same gross revenue would be obtained.
The first of these alternatives is, of course, impracticable, and the
second one is certainly not likely to be attained for some time to
come, and even then account would have to be taken of the
additional working expenses occasioned by so large an increase
of traffic. It is on account of these difficulties that any system
of uniform fares has hitherto been regarded as impracticable.</p>

<p>The solution of this problem was suggested to me by the
practice of the Post Office of charging 3d. for express delivery,
and 6d. for a telegram. Here we have the third rule before
referred to of charging according to speed of service. Applying
this to railways, and again searching for the lowest fares now
charged for fast Main line trains, it will be observed that these are
the regular cheap excursion fares of 2s. 6d. from London to
Brighton or Southend and back, which amounts to 1s. 3d. each
way. It is true that these are exceptionally cheap fares. Return
tickets only are issued at this price, available by certain trains only,
but on the principle already laid down that the flat rate must not
exceed the lowest, this forms the basis of the proposed uniform
fare of 1s. for Main line trains. Although this uniform fare is
so exceptionally low, it is still nearly double the present average
fare, and it is precisely on the Main line trains that increase of
traffic (now restricted by expense) is sure to take place. These
facts (as will appear in the chapter, “Finance of the Scheme”)
enable me to estimate the increase of passenger traffic required
to make up the present gross revenue at only 15 per cent. of the
present number of passengers carried.</p>

<p><b>For goods traffic</b> the uniform rates suggested have been ascertained
in accordance with the same rules. It is more difficult to
ascertain the present minimum owing to the enormous complication
of goods rates.</p>

<p>Under the present system, goods are divided into eight different
classes according to the rate charged, and a maximum rate is fixed
by law for each class. In the lowest of these classes the rates
vary from one penny and a fraction up to 4d. per ton per mile
for any distance up to 20 miles, and smaller proportionate rates
for distances over 20 miles. But although these are the greatest
amounts that the companies may charge for this class of goods,
they do make special rates of considerably lower amounts for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
special kinds of goods. It is estimated that five-sevenths of all
the goods carried are charged according to special rates not
included in the eight classes mentioned.</p>

<p>The Board of Trade returns give the totals of two classes of
goods only, namely, “minerals,” of which 410 million tons are
carried, and “general merchandise,” of which only 116 million
tons are carried. These returns are possibly misleading as, although
derived from returns made by the several companies
themselves, it may be that those returns include the same goods
sent over different lines.</p>

<p>For the purposes of my estimates, however, I have assumed
that the Board of Trade returns are correct, and if they are so,
the average charge for “minerals” is now about 1s. 6d. per ton,
and for “general merchandise” about 6s. per ton. Taking the
two classes of goods traffic together, as representing what under
my scheme will be the “slow goods traffic,” <b>the average is only
2s. 4d. per ton</b>.</p>

<p>The average rate of 1s. 6d. per ton has been suggested for
the slow service because it is believed that this average will allow
of a rate for all goods in open trucks as small as the lowest rate
now charged for minerals for short distances, the average being
maintained by higher rates chargeable for other kinds of goods
as already described. If the actual tonnage of goods carried is
really less than that mentioned in the official returns (it cannot
be more), it may be found necessary to fix a somewhat higher
uniform rate, and the estimates may be affected to a certain
degree. The figures, especially those relating to goods traffic,
are put forward by way of suggestion only, and there should be
no difficulty in ascertaining a uniform rate in accordance with
the rules already stated.</p>

<p>It is believed that any difficulty in this respect will be solved
by the large accession of traffic by Fast service, which, as with
Main line passengers, is sure to follow the adoption of the scheme.</p>

<p>The average rate for “fast” service has been obtained by
ascertaining the lowest rate now charged for goods carried “per
passenger train.” This appears to be the rate for returned empties
for any distance up to 25 miles, namely, 6d. per cwt. (equals 10s.
per ton). There is also a charge of £1 for a load not exceeding
2 1/2 tons on carriage trucks attached to a passenger train for a distance
of 40 miles, and thereafter at 6d. a mile. It is evident that an
average of 10s. per ton would allow of a still smaller rate than
that amount for goods carried in bulk and in large consignments.</p>

OBJECTIONS TO THE SCHEME.</h2>

<p>I now propose to consider objections which may be raised to
the proposed scheme.</p>

<p>I anticipate opposition from those who object to all forms of
<b>State Ownership</b> or State Management.</p>

<p>The late Lord Avebury was one of the most prominent
opponents of nationalisation, and his views are set out in his
book “On Municipal and National Trading.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Edwin A. Pratt has written several books on the subject
and has recently collected all the arguments up to date against
State Ownership in his book, “The Case against Railway
Nationalisation,”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In this book examples are given of the
experience of foreign countries and the Colonies where railways
have been taken over by the State.</p>

<p>Other writers who have advocated the retention of our
present system, and are quoted with approval by Lord Avebury,
are the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>Messrs. G. Foxwell and T. C. Farrer (now Lord Farrer), in
“Express Trains, English and Foreign.” (1889);</p>

<p>Mr. W. M. Acworth, in “The Railways and the Traders”;</p>

<p>Mr. H. R. Meyer, in “Government Regulation of Railway
Rates,” and in “Railway Rates”;</p>

<p class="noindent">and Lord Farrer and Mr. Giffin, in “The State in its Relation
to Trade.”</p>

</div>

<p>On the other side, the following, among other advocates of
railway nationalisation have shown the great advantages to be
anticipated by such a measure, and have given very cogent
answers to the objections of the opponents, namely:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>Mr. William Cunningham, “Railway Nationalisation.”
(Published by himself at Dunfermline, 1906, 2s. 6d.);</p>

<p>Mr. Clement Edwards, M.P., “Railway Nationalisation.”
(Methuen &amp; Co., 1907, 2s. 6d.);</p>

<p class="noindent">and Mr. Emil Davies in several books, including his latest, already
referred to, “The Case for Railway Nationalisation.” (Collins,
1913, 1s.)</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>But in all these books, and in other books and articles, both
for and against nationalisation, it has been assumed that if, and
when, the railways are acquired by the State, the same system
will obtain as now, and as obtains in the case of all the foreign
countries and colonies referred to, namely, <b>to charge according
to distance and according to “what the traffic will bear,”
and with the primary object of making the most profit</b>.</p>

<p>With very great deference to all these distinguished writers,
it appears to me that they have one and all overlooked the fundamental
principles which should be acted upon by a State or a
Municipality first in deciding whether or not to acquire a monopoly,
and secondly, in the administration of it when acquired. These
principles depend upon <b>the fundamental difference between the
objects in view, and actuating a Company or individual on
the one hand and a Nation or Municipality on the other in
acquiring a monopoly</b>. In the former case the <b>sole object</b> is
that of <b>pecuniary gain or profit</b>; in the latter the <b>sole object</b>
is, or ought to be, the <b>benefit of the community</b>. It may be said
that these are not respectively the sole objects, but only the
<b>primary objects</b>. My reply is that in the case of the company
it is the duty of the directors, as trustees for the shareholders,
to so carry on the business in question as to produce the
most profit, irrespective of any benefit to the community, or, indeed,
to any persons other than the shareholders. Railway
companies, it is true, provide the benefit of transport, and various
advantages held out by the companies as inducements to use their
particular lines, but these are, of course, solely offered with the
view of increasing the profits. Other advantages for the comfort,
safety and benefit of the public are provided under compulsion
from the Government, as a condition of the grant of privileges
and compulsory powers conferred upon the companies, without
which the railways could not have been made. I refer to such
matters as rules and regulations for the safety and benefit of the
public; workmen’s trains; maximum fares and rates allowed to be
charged; provision for at least one train a day at all stations, etc.</p>

<p>Conversely, in the case of a Nation or Municipality taking over
a monopoly, it is the duty of the Government Department or Town
Council to so carry on the business as to render the most efficient
service, at the lowest cost consistent with efficiency, with paying
for the cost of acquisition and with paying the working expenses.
Advocates of nationalisation urge that profits should be applied
in reduction of taxation, and suggest that this is in itself one of
the benefits to be derived therefrom. Opponents always assume
that national and municipal trading must be carried on with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
view to profit, and some even ridicule the idea that any trading
concern can be successfully carried on unless with this view and
with a resulting profit. Acrimonious discussions have taken place
as to whether profits which have been claimed by advocates of
municipal trading to have been made by tramways, gas, water
and electricity works, are only paper profits as alleged by the
opponents. In Lord Avebury’s book already referred to,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> one
whole chapter, headed “Loss and Profit,” treats of the question
whether municipal enterprises have been profitable or not, and
he adduces many examples to prove that in most cases the alleged
profits are imaginary.</p>

<p>It has, in fact, been the practice universally to apply profits
made out of municipal trading in this Country in reduction of
rates, and in foreign Countries, where railways are owned by the
State, their revenues are made use of either as general revenue
or, as in Prussia, for social or educational purposes, which would
otherwise be provided for by direct taxation. The only instance
of national trading in this Country is the General Post Office,
and I think it is correct to say that the original intention when
Penny Post was established was to so carry it on that working
expenses only should be covered by the revenue. In practice, the
gross revenue is entered with other items of revenue in the
National Accounts, and the gross expenditure with other items
of general and non-productive expenditure, with the result that
the net profits of the Post Office, in effect, become a source of
general revenue, and are therefore applied in reduction of general
taxation. Until recent years this net profit has not been considerable,
but last year it was as much as £5,000,000. Having
regard to the continual and progressive increase in postal business,
and the acquisition of the whole telephone system, there is
every prospect of still further increase in net profits. What will
be the result of a continuance of this practice of applying net
profits of Municipal and National trading towards reduction of
rates and taxes? It has not, so far, had any very serious result,
simply on account of the fact that such net profits have not yet
been of a very startling amount. But if these profits should increase,
will not the result be the very evils which are the natural
consequence of a private monopoly?</p>

<p>Once the principle is admitted that profits from such trading
shall go in relief of taxation, the service will, and must, be worked
more or less with the primary object of making as much profit
as possible, with the inevitable result that the service in question
will be starved for the sake of the profits. This has actually
happened in the case of the Prussian State Railways, the one
State Railway which has so far made the greatest net profit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to this difficulty there are others inherent in State
or Municipal trading, if the principle of making profits be
admitted, and if profits are actually made. In such a case the
Chancellor of the Exchequer will be expected to budget for
further profits, the general public will expect improvements in
the service, traders will expect that the charges to them should
be reduced, and the workers will expect that their wages should
be increased.</p>

<p>This view is not a new one. It has been advocated in respect
of the Post Office for many years by such well-known postal reformers
as Lord Eversley (formerly Mr. Shaw Lefevre), and Sir
Henniker Heaton, Bart. The latter, I believe, has several times
moved resolutions in the House of Commons for the express
purpose of having the postal profit applied to the use of the
Post Office itself, instead of to general revenue.</p>

<p>It is well known that “<b>strikes</b>” are more likely to arise in a
period of trade prosperity. It is the natural result of the workers
seeing large profits made out of their industry, if they should
have no benefit, by increase of wages, by sharing in such profits
or otherwise. It makes but little difference to the workers
that those profits go to ratepayers, instead of to shareholders,
more especially as they usually inhabit houses let on weekly
inclusive rentals, and are exempt from income-tax, so that they
do not directly pay either rates or taxes. If, on the other hand,
the profits are devoted to improving the efficiency of the service
or cheapening the charges, then, not only are there no profits
to excite the cupidity of various sections of the community, but
the workers do, in fact, benefit by themselves and their families,
as well as the whole of the public for whom the services are
worked. No strike is ever successful which does not gain general
public support, and even under existing conditions there is much
less likelihood of strikes in the case of Civil Servants or postal
or municipal employees, partly on account of the better wages
paid, the certainty of continuing in employment except for misconduct,
and the prospects of a pension, but still more on account
of the practical certainty that public support would not be given
to a strike which interferes with one of the most important of
the public services.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Another evil of ignoring the difference in principle of a public
monopoly and a private monopoly has been the practice of applying
to public monopolies the practice which all private monopolies
endeavour to achieve (and properly so as their sole object is
profit), namely, to put down all possible competition. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
principle I advocate, namely, that the <b>sole object of a public
monopoly is the benefit of the community</b>, then if some
improvement in the service, the subject of such monopoly,
shall be invented, which is proved to be practicable, the public
should have the benefit of such improvement, and, <b>instead of a
prohibition of such private enterprise every encouragement
should be given</b> to it.</p>

<p>In our Navy, when new inventions are found which increase
its efficiency, no time or money is lost in adopting them, even at
the expense of discarding comparatively modern men-of-war or
appliances. The risk to the nation of not doing so is too great
to allow considerations of expense to stand in the way.</p>

<p>But what has happened in the case of so important a commercial
matter as the Telephone? The Post Office are authorised
by Act of Parliament to forbid any competition, a provision
evidently enacted under the impression that a public monopoly
must have Statutory protection against competition, which a
private monopoly always seeks to obtain, but has to pay for.
Having this monopoly, and having purchased the telegraphs, the
Post Office from the first regarded telephones with the utmost
jealousy, because it seemed likely to interfere with its “Profits”!
Lord Avebury quotes from “The Times” of 13th June, 1884,
as follows:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… the action of the Post Office has been so
directed as to throw every possible difficulty in the way
of the development of the telephone, and of its constant
employment by the public. We say advisedly, ‘every possible
difficulty,’ because the regulations under which licences
have been granted to the telephone companies are in many
respects as completely prohibitory as an absolute refusal
of them.” “… the effects of this claim are nearly
as disastrous to the Country as to the inventors and owners
of the instruments.”</p>

</div>

<p>When it is remembered that the Post Office insisted on being
paid one-tenth, not of the profits, but of the gross receipts, the
wonder is that our telephone system is not more backward than
it is. Lord Avebury, of course, uses this and other instances,
such as the opposition of municipalities owning tramway and
gas undertakings, to tramway extensions in adjoining districts,
and licences to motor omnibuses and also to the introduction of
electricity for lighting and power, as an argument against
nationalisation and municipal trading.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> That these constitute
a strong argument against public monopolies being worked for
profit, I readily admit, but they do not weaken the argument that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
all such concerns which must, in their very nature, be incapable
of effective competition, should be taken over by the community,
and be worked solely for its benefit. What possible chance is
there of competition in a telephone system? It is, of course, an
essential element to its success that each subscriber should be
able to communicate with every other one. How, then, can it
ever have been imagined that there could be any effective competition
between rival systems? And yet competition was
actually attempted between various municipalities and the National
Telephone Company, and afterwards the Post Office itself was
authorised to “compete” with that Company.</p>

<p>The ultimate purchase by the State was, of course, a foregone
conclusion, but at what expense of both time and money has this
at length been effected! The complaints which have been made
since the completion of this purchase are evidently the result, not
of nationalisation, but of the mistaken practice followed in a
fruitless attempt at making or retaining so-called “profits” of
the telegraph system, by at first putting “every possible difficulty”
in the way of telephones, then attempting to compete with them,
and then waiting a number of years before completing the purchase,
with the result of being compelled to take over a large
number of obsolete plant and instruments, and linking them up
with a new system, thus producing a state of confusion and useless
expenditure of time and money, which could all have been
avoided by purchase of the patents and patent rights more than
30 years ago.</p>

<p>It is only right to say that Lord Avebury was still of opinion
in 1907 that the resolution of the Government to buy up the
National Telephone Company was “an extraordinary and most
unfortunate policy.”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Hanbury, who was the Minister mainly responsible in
1906 for the purchase of the telephones, had evidently changed
his opinion since 1889, when, in answer to a deputation in favour
of purchasing the telephones, he said, according to a report
quoted by Lord Avebury from “The Times”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If the telephone service was cast upon the Post Office
it would be to the detriment of both the postal and telegraph
services. Then, again, it would increase enormously the
Government staff. He need only appeal to the Members
of Parliament present to say whether they would like to
have the weekly appeals for increase of wages from those
State servants still further extended.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here we have exactly one of the arguments which is now
being used against railway nationalisation, and by the very
Minister who, 17 years after, did the very thing he had clearly
condemned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>I admit the argument would hold good if the restriction be
not imposed by an inflexible rule that there should be no attempt
to work the concern, whether Post Office, telephone, railway or
other monopoly for purposes of profit.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the mistake the Post Office are
making in following the example of the private monopolist, the
National Telephone Company, in charging for telephones according
to distance, although between the very same towns in which
different rates are charged the same department charges 6d.
only for telegrams! This can only be with the strange, yet futile,
intention of making more profit without regard to the benefit
of the community. If the same rate were charged for Trunk
calls as for local calls, many more provincial and country
people would subscribe, and the wires being already laid and
exchanges established, the additional expense would be but small.</p>

<p>It would seem, indeed, that the search after profits in the case
of Government or municipal monopolies is as futile as the search
by people after happiness, personified by Maeterlinck as “The
Blue Bird,” and that when the only object is to benefit the community,
the profits come, as does happiness, when the only object
is that of benefiting other people.</p>

<p>Now, in considering the principle here laid down, it appears
to me that there are four rules which should be observed when
a nation or municipality undertakes anything in the nature of a
trading concern:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>1. Only such concerns should be taken over as are, and
must be, <b>in the very nature of things, a monopoly</b>, or,
in other words, are not susceptible of effective competition.</p>

<p>2. Any such concern taken over should be worked with
<b>the sole object in view of benefiting the community</b>
and, therefore, the charges made should be so adjusted
as to pay for the acquisition of the concern
and for working expenses, and any surplus from time
to time applied, only in improving the efficiency of the
undertaking, or in reducing the charges made.</p>

<p>3. In the event of any invention or improvement being
made, and proved to be commercially successful,
whereby the benefit to the community can be increased,
and provided the concern remains in its nature a
monopoly, such improvements should be taken over
and worked by the State or municipality, and meantime
<b>there should be no prohibition of any private
enterprise carried on in competition</b> apparent or real.</p>

<p>4. All such concerns, whether national or municipal, should
be worked or directed by one or more Department of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
State, having at its head a Minister, who should be a
Member of the Cabinet, and <b>responsible to the House
of Commons, and as such liable to a vote of censure
for any abuse or want of efficiency in the concern</b>.</p>

</div>

<p>As to Rule No. 1, there appears sometimes to be a very thin
line between what is, and is not, susceptible of effective competition.
As a general rule, <b>any concern which involves a right or
easement over land, must be in the nature of a monopoly</b>.
Thus the supply of gas, water and electricity, all of which must be
conveyed by pipes or wires into houses, are in the nature of a
monopoly, but the fittings used in the houses are not, but are
susceptible of very efficient competition, both as to workmanship,
manufacture and design. All roads, including railroads and tramways,
are, and must be, in the nature of a monopoly, but the
manufacture of materials and rolling stock, the catering of hotels,
forming part of the railway undertakings, or in the trains themselves,
or in railway steamers, are all the subject of effective competition
and should, therefore, be put up for competition with
special supervision and restrictions against abuse of the privileges
obtained by competition on Government property.</p>

<p>Now, I would ask any unprejudiced reader who has studied
the writings of the eminent authors already quoted, and other
opponents of nationalisation, to read those books again with these
four rules in his mind, and consider whether all the objections
so forcibly brought forward against nationalisation would not be
very nearly, if not completely, answered, if such nationalisation
were carried out with strict adherence to these rules.</p>

<p>I venture to think that Lord Avebury himself would have
admitted the force of this contention. It would, at least, answer
the question he puts more than once, “Where, indeed, is it
(municipal and national trading) to stop? Is it to stop at all?…
It is sometimes said that the line should be drawn
at necessaries. But if so, to light, gas, water and tramways, we
should have to add bread, meat, fire insurance, … etc.,
while many would also add tobacco, tea and beer.”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In effect, the whole of the objections to State ownership, as
will appear from a perusal of the various books referred to above,
and the arguments of other opponents, are all comprised under
three heads, namely, according to the relationship of the State:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>1. With traders.</p>

<p>2. With railway servants.</p>

<p>3. With the general public, especially on such matters as
officialism and inefficiency, owing to want of competition,
bad administration, and interference with private
enterprise.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The first of the two objections referred to is that the Government
would be in the great difficulty of having to meet the conflicting
interests of traders and merchants on the one hand, and the
general public on the other, with continual disputes as to the
claims of various parties, and possible attempts to bring influence
to bear on the Government and Members of Parliament. This
objection was raised by the Prime Minister recently in reply to a
deputation supporting railway nationalisation. The difficulty has
been found in countries where railways are State owned, and
would, I admit, be a most serious objection, if, after nationalisation,
the railways should be worked on the same principle as now,
namely, with the object of making the most profit possible, and
charging according to “what the traffic will bear.”</p>

<p>The objection, however, disappears if the proposed rules are
adhered to, especially when, as in the proposed scheme, fares and
rates are fixed irrespective of distance, locality, class of traders or
goods, and in which, therefore, no question of preference or,
indeed, of any conflicting interests can arise.</p>

<p>As to the second heading, affecting the relationship of the State
with the railway servants. It is suggested that the railway servants
(who would, on nationalisation, become Civil servants)
could use their voting powers to exact undue privileges for themselves
which they cannot now obtain, and that serious abuses
might arise owing to the great political power exercised by a
large increase in the number of voters who are also Civil servants.</p>

<p>This does not appear to me so formidable an objection as the
first, but it is quite possible that a large united body of Civil
servants might have power to so influence the Government as
to extract higher wages or less hours, if they discovered that by
their exertions a very large profit was derived by the railway
system.</p>

<p>Some writers have gone so far as to suggest that all persons
employed by Government should be disfranchised. Others suggest
that special representatives of Government officials should be returned
to Parliament. Others that all such officials should take
the same oath of allegiance as soldiers, and, in short, become
subject to military discipline. In two articles appearing recently
in the “Westminster Gazette,” under the title of “Unrest in the
Railway World, by an Expert,”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> it is suggested that “unless
some discipline of the military kind were introduced” (in the
event of nationalisation), “there would be no available methods
of dealing with a national strike of railwaymen, other than to
concede to their demands.” The question of “Strikes” has already
been dealt with above (<a href="#Page_36">page 36</a>). As to the political
difficulty, although it is true that the number of Civil servants
would be greatly increased (and it has been estimated that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
total number of postal and railway servants who would have the
vote might be as many as 600,000), it must be remembered, as
pointed out by Mr. Emil Davies, that this number is spread over
the whole Country, and the percentages in each district, compared
to the whole number of voters, would not be a large one, except in
railway centres like Crewe, where they already have a preponderance
of votes. In any case, the same considerations which, as
above mentioned, would be likely to prevent strikes, would
operate equally in the region of politics if the four rules mentioned
are adhered to, especially under the proposed scheme, carried
on with the primary object of the public benefit. Exactly the
same conditions would obtain as with the Post Office now.</p>

<p>Other grounds of objection to State ownership are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p><b>1. The fear of inefficiency owing to lack of competition.</b></p>

<p><b>2. The fear of difficulty in obtaining redress for loss
or injury from a Government Department.</b></p>

<p><b>3. The fear of officialism.</b></p>

</div>

<p><b>As to competition</b>, it is now generally admitted that there is
no effective competition on railways.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In most parts of the
country there never has been any competition, as one company
only is available. In others, where more than one company operates,
working arrangements have been made not only as to the
fares and rates but also as to time of trains, thus precluding
any effective competition. In the very nature of things no
competition can be effective in a system of railway transit.</p>

<p>As to the questions of <b>officialism</b> and <b>difficulties of obtaining
redress</b>, can anyone suggest that these are less in the case of
private companies, responsible to no one but themselves, than
in the case of a Government Department with a Cabinet Minister
at the head who is responsible to Parliament? A vote of censure
is one of the most powerful weapons in Constitutional countries
against any serious abuse in a Government Department.</p>

<p>Mr. Edwin A. Pratt, in his book before referred to, cannot but
admit the cogency of the argument in favour of the amalgamation
and unification of the railways, but urges that this should be
accomplished by the amalgamation of the whole of the existing
railways into <b>a Trust or Traffic Board</b>. The answer to this is
that when once constituted, even though appointed by Parliament,
such a Board <b>is responsible to no one but itself</b>, and, however
eminent may be the directors or managers, the want of
ultimate responsibility inevitably and unconsciously leads to
abuses. <b>Can any instance be adduced of the successful working
of any such large Trust or Board?</b> On the other hand, instances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
are well known to the contrary. One of these was the notorious
Metropolitan Board of Works. And is it certain that the Metropolitan
Water Board and the Port of London Authority, both of
which are constituted on similar lines, will answer all the expectations
which were formed of them?</p>

<p>There are, of course, difficulties inherent in the administration
of a great Government Department, but, as already hinted, various
remedies may be suggested for many of these difficulties. For
instance, there might be elected <b>a Railway Council</b> or Standing
Committee in Parliament, consisting of representatives of several
large districts of the United Kingdom, and of which the “Minister
of Transport” would be, ex-officio, the President. In the
first instance possibly some of the present directors of railway
companies, many of whom are already in Parliament, could be
members of this Council. Any proposals for improvements, extensions
or alterations in the services of the railway or Post Office
would be submitted to and decided upon by this Council or Committee,
subject to an appeal to Parliament on questions of principle
or finance. This would be one means of obviating an objection
found in some countries where the railways are owned by the
State, namely, the continual trivial complaints made in Parliament
about the railways.</p>

<p>A further suggestion is that a <b>special Railway Court</b> should
be established in London with branches in every important centre,
and presided over by competent arbitrators to determine and
adjudicate upon claims against the Department for personal
injuries to passengers and servants, or for loss of or damage to
goods, or by reason of delay, any one accident, involving a large
number of claims, being dealt with by the same Court instead of
being, as now, the subject of innumerable actions at law in the
ordinary Courts. This Railway Court might also be useful in
settling disputes between the Government and the men.</p>

<h3>OTHER OBJECTIONS.</h3>

<p>Apart from the objection to State ownership there are no doubt
many who are now deriving income from railways who will fear
that their interests may be prejudiced by the proposed change.
Fortunately <b>there can be but very few who will be thus prejudiced</b>.
As to the existing staffs, such as booking clerks and the Railway
Clearing House staff, whose services would no longer be required
in those particular departments, there ought to be more than
sufficient vacancies for these in other but more necessary branches
of the railway service, especially in view of the increased traffic
which is sure to arise.</p>

<p><b>Many traders</b> who may at first sight consider that their profits
would suffer if the scheme is adopted <b>will find</b> on further consideration
<b>that the benefits</b> they will have by the proposed scheme
<b>will be greater</b> than any loss they could possibly sustain. To take
one instance. <b>Newspaper proprietors</b> may consider that upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
railways being nationalised they would lose the benefit of the
extensive and remunerative advertisements they now receive
from competing railway companies. So far from there being
any loss, there will be profits, partly by the official
announcements which the Department will cause to be inserted in
all newspapers of time tables, rates, etc., but even more so by the
enormous saving in the carriage of paper and of the newspapers,
in travelling expenses of special correspondents and others, and
by the additional profits arising from increased circulation which
is sure to follow upon the increased facility and cheapness of
distribution.</p>

<p>Mr. W. M. Acworth, the well-known railway expert, to whom
I submitted a rough draft of this pamphlet, was kind enough,
while refraining from any detailed criticism, to call my attention
to what he considered a difficulty in my proposals. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The fundamental objection to a scheme of average fares
and rates is that people whose fares and goods rates are
‘averaged up’ will, so far as possible, cease to use the
trains; those whose fares and rates are ‘averaged down’
will increase enormously, with a corresponding increase in
working expenses. Have you appreciated that under your
scheme a passenger from London to Glasgow would, in
fact, in most cases pay, not 1s., but 3d. or 4d., by taking
local tickets from London to Birmingham, Birmingham to
Crewe, etc?”</p>

</div>

<p>And he instances the Hungarian zone system, which has completely
broken down, as a case in point.</p>

<p>My answer to this is, first, that according to my scheme there
is no “averaging up;” the flat fares are all “averaged down”
to the minimum. Secondly, while welcoming the admission that
the effect of “averaging down” is to increase the traffic “enormously,”
I am sure that Mr. Acworth himself does not mean
that the working expenses will increase in anything like the same
proportion. He has himself pointed out in an article on railways<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
that the train cost of carrying 200 passengers and 10 passengers
is practically the same. Further reasons for this fact are given
under the heading of “Working Expenses” in this pamphlet.
Thirdly, while admitting that under my scheme a passenger might,
by taking three local trains which stop at all stations travel from
London to Glasgow for 3d., I can hardly imagine that any but
the smallest percentage of travellers would endeavour to save
9d. by taking a journey in which they would spend sixteen hours
and have two changes at least, instead of travelling the same
distance by one train, in eight hours, for 1s. As to the zone
system, the whole advantage of the flat rate or uniform fare is
lost by the difficulty of passing from one zone to the other.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
FINANCE OF THE SCHEME.</h2>

<p>The final and most important criticism of the scheme will be
on the matter of finance.</p>

<p>The question is, can a sufficient revenue be obtained from the
small uniform fares and rates proposed, after providing for working
expenses, to pay not only interest on the purchase money but
the purchase money itself?</p>

<p>It is a curious coincidence that in the year 1838, before Penny
Postage was instituted, the average amount received for every
chargeable letter was 7d. and a fraction&mdash;the actual average railway
fare now paid by every passenger (excluding season tickets).</p>

<p>The number of letters carried during the first complete year
after the uniform rate of 1d. was adopted was more than doubled.
Notwithstanding this the deficiency in net revenue was about
£2,000,000, and the deficiency was made good out of general
revenue, this being well worth while owing to the great benefit
to the nation of Penny Postage.</p>

<p>In the case of railways, however, the amount involved is so
large that no Government could be expected to give any consideration
to a proposal which would involve making good so large a
deficiency as would be occasioned by the reduction to a flat rate
of 1d. As will be gathered from the remarks made when dealing
with the principles of the scheme, this difficulty is now overcome
by dividing the traffic on railways, both of passengers and goods,
into two kinds of service, namely, Fast and Slow. It will be
found that by this means <b>no greater percentages of increase of
traffic will be required to produce the same gross revenue as at
present than 15 per cent. of passenger traffic and 10 per cent. of
goods traffic</b>. It will also be shown that if the increase of traffic
should not exceed this estimate the additional working expenses
will be so small that they would be more than met by the economies
effected by unification. If these propositions prove to be
true, then there will be no deficiency to be provided for.</p>

<p>It is necessary in order to prove this to set out the figures of
the present receipts and expenses, and an estimate of the same
under the proposed new scheme.</p>

<h3>ESTIMATES UNDER PROPOSED SCHEME.</h3>

<h4>(<i>a</i>) As to passenger traffic.</h4>

<p>There is, of course, no official return as to the proportions
of Main line and Local passenger traffic, but it is clear that
the percentage of small fares must be very great. Assume that
this is over 80 per cent., then there would be in round figures
about 300,000,000 (that is under 20 per cent.) of Main line
passenger journeys, and assuming that the number of first class
passengers will be only 10 per cent. (the above average percentage
of first and second class passengers), then the revenue from the
existing number of passengers under the new scheme would be
as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <td class="tdr total bb">£29,250,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">as against the present total of £45,000,000, or a deficiency of
about £16,000,000 per annum, assuming there should be no increase
in the existing traffic. This seems an appalling deficiency,
but “Wait and See!”</p>

<p>It is quite clear that there would be a very large increase of
traffic, more particularly of the long distance or Main line passengers,
as under the existing system the fares for short distances
up to 12 or even 20 miles are sufficiently low to remove practically
all restrictions. In the case of long distances, however, there
is this double restriction for passengers&mdash;namely, the time occupied
and the high price of the fares. If the latter restriction is removed
a very large increase of traffic is sure to result, not only for
purposes of pleasure but also for business and trade purposes.
The Local traffic will also increase partly by reason of the
increased number of long distance passengers requiring the use
of the Local lines (both suburban and small branch lines), and
partly by the reduction to 1d. of many of the present suburban
fares. In order, however, to be on the safe side in the estimate,
I propose to take no account of any increase in Local passengers
and to reckon only the increase required in the number of
Main line passenger journeys. It will then be found that
250,000,000 more Main line passengers will provide for the above
large yearly deficiency, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="How passenger increases will pay">

    <td></td>
    <td class="tdr">250,000,000</td>

    <td colspan="3"></td>
    <td class="tdr total bb">£17,500,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This will bring the gross receipts from passengers to
£46,750,000, with <b>an increase of about 15 per cent. only</b> on the
present total number of passengers carried, and £1,750,000 more
revenue.</p>

<p>The criticism may be made, however, that this number is
nearly double the existing number of long distance passengers.
Will such an increase be realised?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>From a consideration of the following reasons it is submitted
that not only will it be so, but that in point of fact a much larger
increase may reasonably be anticipated.</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>1. No account as to passenger traffic has been taken of
the normal increase in the number of passengers which
has continued to increase regularly with the increase
of population.</p>

<p>2. Under the proposed scheme the uniform fares are for
<i>as far as the train travels only</i>, so that a journey say
from London to Londonderry will involve at least three
1s. tickets, one to Holyhead, a second from Holyhead
to Dublin, and a third from Dublin to Londonderry,
whereas under the present system one through ticket
would be purchased and would appear in the official
returns as one journey only.</p>

<p>3. In practice nearly every single journey undertaken
means <i>a return journey home</i>, so that an increase of
250,000,000 more passenger journeys does not involve
a greater increase in the movement of the population
than is represented by, say, 150,000,000 passengers.</p>

<p>4. If the number of passengers carried by the railways is
compared with the population it may be noted that
the total number of passengers carried last year in
the Tube and Suburban Railways of London, with a
population of between six and seven millions, was
about 500,000,000 in addition to about the same number
carried by omnibuses, and a further similar number
by tramways. A similar proportion of railway passengers
to the population of the United Kingdom of nearly
50 millions would be over 4,000,000,000 per annum,
so that an actual total of 1,850,000,000 would undoubtedly
be much less than may reasonably be anticipated.</p>

<p>5. It is not only the increased number of people who would
travel to and from all parts of the country who now
cannot or will not do so on account of the expense,
but also the increase in the number of journeys undertaken
by existing travellers. Parents living in remote
parts of the country whose children work in large
towns and who, on account of high fares, cannot visit
each other, business men and commercial travellers
who will multiply their long distance journeys for business
purposes if they can do for 2s. what now costs
10 or 20 times as much, are a few among many classes
who will swell the number. It will be remembered that
by far the greater proportion of the population are
those in receipt of an income of less than £3 per week
to whom any fares of 10s. or over are prohibitive
except in extreme cases.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Let me give one very homely illustration which has come
under my notice. A domestic servant in London had a serious
illness, necessitating an operation at one of the hospitals. Her
parents lived in humble circumstances in a Cornish village. The
mother came to London and had to pay £2 for a return ticket.
Her daughter had to remain about two months in the hospital
while the mother had to return home without being able to afford
the luxury of another return journey to London. But during the
whole of that time trains were going to and from the same place
every day and night with plenty of room for the old lady, who
could, of course, have been carried any number of times without
any appreciable cost to the company.</p>

<p>Now, suppose the uniform fare of 1s. each way had come into
operation, she or some other member of the family would, no
doubt, have come up at least once a week, and instead of one
return ticket which cost £2, and would be included in the Board
of Trade returns as two passenger journeys, the family would
have only paid 16s. for the eight double journeys, the extra cost
to the Government would be nil and the increase in the number
of passenger journeys would be 14.</p>

<p>It is not unusual to see long distance trains arrive in London
with not more than 15 or 20 passengers.</p>

<h4>(<i>b</i>) As to goods traffic.</h4>

<p>For the purposes of the estimates of goods traffic there must
be added to existing total receipts from goods train traffic the
amount included in the official returns under the head of “passenger
traffic” of £10,000,000 received for mails, luggage,
and other goods carried by passenger trains, making the total
revenue for goods at present of £74,000,000. There is no official
Return as to the tonnage of goods carried by passenger trains, but
assuming that the present average rate for goods carried by
passenger trains is £2 per ton, this would represent a further
tonnage, irrespective of passengers’ luggage, of 20,000,000 tons.</p>

<p>The figures under the new scheme, if there should be no increase
in the tonnage carried, and assuming that goods by fast
service should be no more than the amount now estimated per
passenger train, would thus be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Figures under the new scheme">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Following the analogy of the passenger traffic, I will only
estimate for an increased traffic by fast trains, and for this
purpose there will be required:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>48,000,000 tons, which at 10s. equals £24,000,000, and will
bring the total to £800,000 more than the present total receipts
from goods, by both passenger and goods trains.</p>

</div>

<p>This increased tonnage it will be seen is <b>an increase of under
10 per cent.</b> on the present total of 550,000,000 tons. It is
probable that with a reduction of freight per fast train to the
uniform rate of 10s. per ton, a considerable proportion of existing
goods train traffic would be transferred to fast trains, so that the
same figure might be arrived at with much less increase in tonnage.
This fact may also be taken into account when adjusting any
mistake in the official figures of the total tonnage carried.</p>

<p>As in the case of passenger traffic, this percentage is surely
not only a reasonable estimate, but one which may reasonably be
anticipated, and, further, the increase will be progressive.</p>

<p>The following among other reasons may be adduced:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>1. The <b>example of the Post Office</b> is the best precedent
that can be given of the result of the adoption of a
minimum uniform rate. In the year before the introduction
of Penny Post the number of letters per head
of population was only three. This number is now
72, irrespective of postcards and parcels, and it is
still increasing. The number of letters carried in 1838
was 70,000,000. In the first complete year after the
Penny Post was established this number was doubled.
In 1863 it had multiplied by eight times, and since
then it has been doubled in about every period of 20
years.</p>

<p>2. The large amount of <b>goods sent now by road</b>, especially
in recent years by motors and steam tractors on account
not only of the heavy railway rates but also the cost
of loading and unloading, would with uniform rates
be sent by rail. In this connection it may be mentioned
that a very considerable increase of carriage by trolley
trucks of loaded carts and pantechnicons, or of the
“containers” advocated by the New Transport Company,
Limited, thus avoiding both shunting and the
double expense of packing and unpacking, may reasonably
be anticipated.</p>

<p>3. A still greater increase in fast train traffic may be expected
in <b>perishable articles</b>, such as fruit, fish,
milk and dairy produce. The so-called reduced rates
now in force for instance for carriage of fresh fruit
vary from 1s. 6d. per cwt. (equals £1 10s. per ton),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
from Hampshire to London up to as much as 8s. per
cwt. (equals £8 per ton), from Hampshire to Scotland,
these rates being “reduced” on account of the
large amount of fruit (strawberries), requiring in the
season special trains carrying nothing but fruit. The
rates for the same goods from other parts where the
quantity is not so considerable are in some cases more
than double, so that the farmers cannot afford to send
the goods. The rates for fish are similar, and the
same considerations apply, so that very little is consigned
to town except from fishing centres like Grimsby
where large quantities are available.</p>

<p>4. <b>With a regular service</b> from every station, village stations
as well as the large towns, and <b>similar to the
present postal service</b>, in fact forming an extension to
all goods of the present Parcels Post service, no one
can doubt that the total increase will be considerably
more than the 10 per cent. estimated for.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
WORKING EXPENSES.</h2>

<p>Most critics will contend that the increased traffic will lead
to an enormous increase of working expenses.</p>

<p>In the first place allowance must be made for the several
economies in management occasioned by the amalgamation of the
whole railway systems in one and with the Post Office as already
mentioned, and of which the following is a brief list, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>Abolition of,</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>(<i>a</i>) The Clearing House,</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Separate boards of directors and clerical staffs,</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Legal and Parliamentary expenses,</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Advertisements,</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Book-keeping, printing and booking clerks now required
for differential fares and rates.</p>

</div>

<p>Economies by avoiding,</p>

<div class="blockquote-list">

<p>(<i>a</i>) Competing Receiving Offices, Post Offices or stations
in same localities,</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Competing trains,</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The waste of rolling stock now occasioned by the ownership
of different companies, instead of being used
according to the requirements of traffic.</p>

</div>

<p>The latter has already been referred to in Chapter II.
A further proof of a practical nature was given by Mr.
Oliver Bury, the retiring General Manager of the Great
Northern Railway in 1912, who then said that after the working
arrangement with the Great Central Railway had been entered
into, although there had been an increase of 4,000,000 tons of
merchandise carried, this additional traffic had actually been
worked with a decrease in the goods train mileage of 1,000,000.</p>

<p>Apart from all these economies, <b>the working expenses
cannot increase proportionately with the increase of traffic</b>.
Most of the long distance passenger trains now running,
except on special occasions or holiday time, could easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
hold twice the number of passengers with but little, if any,
appreciable increase in the cost of haulage. It must be remembered
that a sufficiently powerful locomotive and sufficient coal
must be provided for every passenger train, on the assumption
that it will be full, whether it leaves with a full complement of
passengers or not. Therefore, even though the number of passengers
now carried were to be doubled in the case of all Main line
trains very little increase in the working expenses would result,
certainly not so much as the saving effected by the various economies
mentioned. So far as goods traffic is concerned, an increase
of 10 per cent. only, as estimated in the tonnage would certainly
not cause any great increase in the expenditure. If, on the other
hand, the increase of traffic should be very much more than the
percentages mentioned (as may very likely be the case), then the
revenue derived will be more than sufficient to provide whatever
additional working expenses there may be. The expenses of the
important items (which constitute probably 50 per cent. of working
expenses) of permanent ways, stations, signal boxes, and
general establishment charges would not be seriously affected by
increase of traffic, only the rolling stock, coal, and part of the
staff.</p>

<p>In addition to these economies, and others set out more fully
in Chapter II., there will also be great economy in the working
expenses of the Post Office itself, including the telegraph and
telephone services. The actual effect of the amalgamation of the
two services of railways and Post Office on the total working
expenses of the combined services cannot be estimated with any
degree of accuracy, but there can be no doubt that it will result
in large economies. The working expenses of both, must, of
course, be lumped together. No advantage can possibly be gained
by attempting to separate the expenses of various branches of one
State Department. This has actually been attempted in the case
of the telegraph service, one of the numerous branches of the
Post Office. It has been continually asserted that this service
has been, and is being, carried on at a loss, especially since the
introduction of the sixpenny rate. This assertion has always been
an enigma to me, for how any proper apportionment of the working
expenses of over 20,000 Post Offices throughout the United
Kingdom can be made, in order to ascertain what proportion is
to be attributed to the telegraph service alone, passes comprehension!</p>

<p>That this impossible task has been attempted, and apparently
carried out to the satisfaction of some persons in authority, does
not prove that the alleged loss has actually been made, but only
that a large amount of time and expense has been lost in elaborate
and costly calculations, which can be of no possible advantage to
the service or the Country! It is to be hoped that this attempt
will not be continued with the telephone service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>If, and when, the scheme proposed in this pamphlet for combining
railways with the General Post Office is carried into effect,
I trust that no such expensive and useless task will be attempted
as to endeavour to ascertain what proportions respectively of the
expenses of running the Royal Railways are to be attributed to
carrying His Majesty’s Mails on the one hand, or His Majesty’s
subjects and their goods on the other!</p>

<p>It is quite evident that on the two services being combined a
portion of the present working expenses of the Post Office,
namely, those which now consist of amounts paid to the Railway
Companies for carriage of mails, for rents of telegraph and telephone
wires, and other services rendered, will be swallowed up
in the general working expenses, just as the gross receipts of the
Post Office will swell the total revenue of the combined services.</p>

<p>For the purposes, however, of ascertaining what increase of
traffic will be required to produce (<i>a</i>) the same net revenue as
under the present system of railways, and (<i>b</i>) a sufficient revenue
to purchase the present system, I have taken no account of the
decrease of Postal expenses nor of the normal increase of the
Postal Revenue. I also am assuming that notwithstanding all
the economies referred to, the working expenses of railways will
remain the same, or even increase, owing to higher prices of
goods and materials and higher wages, to the round sum of
£85,000,000.</p>

<p>It will thus be apparent that ample margin has been allowed
for any increase in working expenses that is likely to take place,
and that allowance has been made for the whole of the existing
staffs to be retained, whether now employed in services which
may then be discarded or not.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;While revising the final proofs of this pamphlet during
the Christmas Holidays, I have noticed in the “Daily Telegraph,”
of 24th December, 1913, a long letter signed “G.P.O.,” referring
to an article in the same well-known newspaper of the
previous day. The letter is printed in prominent type under the
following heading:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Prehistoric Methods of Post Office Finance&mdash;Telegraph
Service ‘Loss.’</span>”</p>

<p>The correspondent, who evidently has expert knowledge of the
subject, refers to the “alleged great loss” of the telegraph service
as “a polite fiction.”</p>

<p>His letter completely confirms the views expressed above as
to the folly of attempting to apportion expenses of one branch of
the service, and he places the cost of the accounts at “hundreds
of thousands of pounds a year!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
TERMS OF PURCHASE.</h2>

<p>If the railway system be purchased by the nation it
will be in contemplation as <b>a business proposition</b> to repay the
capital expended in the purchase, and this means, therefore, that
if this scheme is a practicable one <b>the shareholders and stockholders
of the present companies will be able to receive back
their capital</b>, although, under existing conditions, this appears
absolutely hopeless. It is therefore now proposed to consider
upon what terms the railways can be purchased and how the
purchase money can be provided.</p>

<p>1. By the Railway Act of 1844 the Government is empowered
to purchase every railway company formed after that date. The
price fixed is the equivalent of 25 years’ purchase of the average
annual divisible profits for three years before such purchase,
subject to the proviso that any company whose divisible profits
are less than 10 per cent. on its capital is at liberty to have the
terms of purchase fixed by arbitration. At the date of this Act
most of the Trunk lines, to the extent of about 2,300 miles had
already been constructed and are not therefore subject to the
provisions of this Act, but as the total length of lines open in
1911 was 23,417 miles, it will be observed that the Act applies to
90 per cent. of the whole railway system.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, there are undoubted difficulties in
estimating the actual purchase price, having regard to the fact
that the majority of the smaller companies, including the modern
Tube Railways with their large prospective profits, and probably
the whole of the Irish railways, pay less than 10 per cent. and
would, therefore, be entitled to arbitration.</p>

<p>There is, however, another precedent, viz., (2) The Indian
State Railways, which have been actually purchased by the
Government from the private companies by whom they were
owned.</p>

<p>The dates and terms of purchase of these railways are included
in an official return of railways acquired by the Government.
This return was issued by the Board of Trade in 1908, pursuant
to an order of the House of Commons.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In India the railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
undertakings of 16 separate companies were acquired by the State
between the years 1868 and 1906. Of these companies six were
purchased at a price mutually agreed upon between the Government
and the companies, these being small companies, and the
purchase moneys varying from £30,000 to £300,000. Three companies
were acquired at a purchase price equal to the share capital.
The remaining seven companies were purchased for a sum equal
to the value of the shares calculated at the mean market price
during the three years preceding the date on which notice of
purchase was given. In addition to payment of the purchase price
the Government assumed the liabilities of the company in respect
of debentures and debenture stock. Four of these companies (the
larger ones) were, under an option reserved by the contracts, paid
by annuities spread over 73 or 74 years. One of these, the East
Indian Company, was purchased in 1879 at the price, calculated
on the above basis, of £32,750,000, payable by an annuity of
£1,473,750 for the term of 73 years from 1880. This amounts
exactly to 4¼ per cent. on the purchase money, and will cease to
be payable after the year 1953.</p>

<p>In addition to this annuity, interest is paid on the debentures
and loans amounting altogether to about £16,500,000, the interest
whereon is about £500,000 or a little over 3 per cent.</p>

<p>If the Act of 1844 were now applicable to the whole of the
companies in the United Kingdom, and if we assume that by the
time when the option to purchase is exercised the net profits of
£48,000,000 in 1911 shall have risen to £50,000,000, the purchase
money would be 25 times that sum, viz., £1,250,000,000.</p>

<p>This sum is really slightly more than the total paid-up capital
of the railways after allowing for “watered” stock.</p>

<p>The following were the figures in 1911:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="1911 figures">
  <tr>
    <td>Ordinary Stock</td>
    <td class="tdr">£493,484,151</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Preference and Guaranteed Stock</td>
    <td class="tdr">473,073,163</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Loans and Debentures</td>
    <td class="tdr">357,461,047</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Total paid-up Capital</b></td>
    <td class="tdr total bb">£1,324,018,361</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>There is included in this total, stock to the nominal value of
£198,000,000, or approximately 15 per cent., which represents
nominal additions made on consolidations and divisions of stock,
and commonly known as “watered” stock.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the present net revenue of £48,000,000
only represents an average of about 3½ per cent. on this total
paid-up capital. The total paid-up capital in the returns recently
published for 1912 is £1,334,963,518.</p>

<p>The Railway Nationalisation Society has prepared heads of a
Bill in Parliament, providing that the price to be paid for the
whole of the railways shall be calculated on the basis of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Act of 1844. No doubt this would be opposed by holders
of railway stocks and shares, having regard to the fact that the
result might be in effect to merely return the capital, no account
being taken of profits. If the purchase of the railways is to be
considered as “a business proposition” it will be necessary to look
fairly at both sides of the question, and endeavour if possible
to arrange terms which will not prove an injustice to the present
owners, and at the same time will be such as can be provided
for out of the ordinary revenue of the railways without financial
loss to the nation.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that shareholders or their predecessors
invested their money with the reasonable and proper expectation
of having an adequate return for it. No doubt they put down
their capital with the primary, possibly the sole, object of benefiting
themselves, but the fact remains that their capital has been
the means of providing the splendid net-work of British Railways
now available for the nation to purchase.</p>

<p>On the other hand, railway stock and shareholders must
recognise that their position under the present system is by no
means an enviable one. Many of them have for years been in
receipt of no dividend whatever. In no case has there been any
attempt at repayment of capital moneys, nor does there seem
any prospect of it. The average net annual receipts now earned
by the whole of the companies is only a fraction over 3½ per
cent., and this percentage (which is less than before the year
1870) has for the last few years been practically stationary.
The working expenses have been increasing to such an extent by
reason of the increase of wages and price of materials that last
year the companies decided on an all-round increase in fares and
rates. According to the latest returns this has already been to
a large extent counteracted by a decrease in traffic.</p>

<p>If, therefore, an offer were made by the Government to purchase
the whole of the railways upon similar terms to those on
which the East Indian Railway was acquired, namely for a sum
equal to the mean market price of the shares during the three
years preceding the year in which the Act to acquire the railways
is introduced, it is submitted that there could be no effective
opposition to the proposal. In effect this would mean a purchase
at a price which is the value the public to-day put upon each line
of railway. The only practical difficulty of this proposal will
be to ascertain the market value of the shares of some of the
smaller companies, many of which are held by the larger companies.</p>

<p>In order, however, to avoid under-estimating the amount required,
I suggest for the purposes of my argument that the
Government and the companies mutually agree on a total sum of
£1,350,000,000 as the purchase price of all the undertakings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the companies, subject to the existing liabilities for loans and
debenture stock, now amounting to £357,500,000, which would
be assumed by the Government. This would make a total in
round figures of £1,700,000,000, or nearly £400,000,000 more than
the total of the ordinary preference and guaranteed stock. Surely
this would be an outside figure. Indeed, it might be suggested
that the nation would be paying an excessive amount.</p>

<p>Mr. E. A. Pratt gives various estimates of what the purchase
price would probably be.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> These vary from £1,052,000,000 up to
£1,769,847,000, an estimate of “The Railway News,” confirmed
by the “Financier and Bullionist,” of September 7th,
1912. “The Financial News” in 1912 suggested £1,941,865,000
in 2½ per cent. Stock in order to yield the present annual income
of £48,546,000.</p>

<p>Taking the precedent of the East Indian Railway as a
mode of payment and without making any allowance for better
terms of interest which the Imperial Government might well obtain,
it will be seen that the annual amount required to provide
a purchase money of £1,350,000,000 and meet the above liabilities
would be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Annuities at the rate of:&mdash;</p>

<p>In these estimates no account has been taken of the increased
revenue of the Post Office, nor the increase in Local passengers
and slow goods traffic respectively, which is sure to be realised,
and the receipts for which would probably cover any increase in
working expenditure. It will be noticed that if the above increase
should be obtained the total estimated increase of passengers
over the present totals would be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Estimated increase">
  <tr>
    <td>Passengers</td>
    <td class="tdr">350,000,000 or about 21%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Goods</td>
    <td class="tdr">78,000,000 or about 15%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>It is, of course, not essential to the success of the scheme
that the whole of the increase here estimated should be obtained
in the first year after nationalisation has been carried out, although
it is considered that even in that short period, according
to all precedents, so small a percentage of profits may fairly be
anticipated. It would probably be necessary for the Government
to raise a temporary loan for initiating the scheme, but in
any case it appears essential that the purchase of the whole of the
existing undertakings of the United Kingdom should be completed
as <b>at one and the same date</b>.</p>

<p>Other advocates of railway nationalisation suggest that the
purchase should be carried out gradually, and this course has been
followed by other nations. It is, however, of the very essence
of the scheme here proposed that every part of the country shall
have the benefit of the uniform fares and rates, and this would
be impracticable unless the whole system be taken over by the
Government at one time.</p>

<p>The proposal that the price should be fixed by taking the mean
price of stocks for the three years preceding the year in which the
Act should be passed, is in order to avoid the market changes which
might be caused by anticipation of purchase by the State. It is
suggested that whatever price is taken as the basis of the purchase
money, such price should include everything, so that the
whole undertaking would be taken over without the necessity
for any valuation of stock and plant, a prolific cause of so much
trouble and expense, as in the case of the purchase of the National
Telephone Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be said that the figures of the railway systems are so
vast that it would be impracticable to cope with them in one
transaction. Enormous as the figures must necessarily be, the
principle is exactly the same as in other financial transactions.
Just as the Government acquired the undertaking of the National
Telephone Company by purchase, which took effect on one day,
so can this much larger transaction, or series of transactions, be
carried out. It is assumed that the existing shares and stocks
of railway companies would be converted into Government Stock,
all necessary apportionments being made up to a date to be named
in the Act of Parliament authorising the acquisition of the railways.
Upon such date the completion of the whole transaction
will be deemed to be effected.</p>

CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p>All reforms meet with opposition, mainly from persons whose
interests may be prejudiced by the proposed change&mdash;also in many
cases by experts. As to the latter, one remembers the story of
the expert who, when the first proposal was made to cross the
Atlantic by steam, wrote a pamphlet conclusively proving, to his
own satisfaction, that it was a scientific impossibility to construct
a steamer capable of carrying sufficient coal to do the journey!
One of the first steamers to cross the Atlantic carried a consignment
of such pamphlets!</p>

<p>As to the former, as has already been pointed out in considering
objections to the scheme, there is but a very small section
whose interests need be prejudiced. Even those few who might
suffer loss by the reform will recognise that the increased facilities
of transport, with accompanying decrease of expense, will inevitably
result in a great increase in and expansion of trade, by reason
of the opening up of markets which have hitherto been practically
inaccessible.</p>

<p>Nor is there any reason why this opening up of new markets
should be confined to the United Kingdom, for if other nations
find that a system of small uniform fares and rates is not only
practicable but remunerative here, they will surely follow our
example, as in the case of Penny Postage, and the day will not
be far distant, after the system has once been adopted in this
country, when it will be possible to travel all over Europe at the
cost of a few shillings, and to transmit and receive goods at
correspondingly low rates.</p>

<p>It is impossible to foresee all the social and political as well
as financial effects which may be produced by such a revolution.
The advantages of travel, which have hitherto been restricted to
the wealthy, will be thrown open to all, whatever their means.</p>

<p>Another important result may be anticipated and hoped for,
namely, that the intermingling of the people of the various races
and nations will tend to remove the prejudices, misconceptions
and misrepresentations which have so often produced disastrous
wars in the past.</p>

<p>Should this be so, it may be that the reform here proposed
will bring nations nearer to the desired haven of Peace.</p>

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
